title: Introduction
description: SeerStack is the observability platform for your product's user behavior.
---

SeerStack lets you ingest user events, unify identities, and visualize data using natural language. It's built for developers who need to understand how their product is being used without spending hours building the perfect dashboards.

## How it works

1.  **Ingest**: Send JSON events and user traits via our API.
2.  **Process**: We validate, enrich, and store your data in real-time.
3.  **Visualize**: Use the dashboard to ask questions like "Show me daily active users" and get instant charts.

import Seerstack from 'seerstack';

const client = new Seerstack({ apiKey: 'sk_live_...' });

// 1. Identify the user
await client.users.identify({
  user_id: 'user_123',
  name: 'Jane Doe',
  email: 'jane@example.com'
});

// 2. Send an event
await client.events.capture({
  name: 'payment.succeeded',
  user_id: 'user_123',
  data: {
    amount: 4900,
    currency: 'usd',
    plan: 'pro'
  }
});
