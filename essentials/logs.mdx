Logs are the immutable history of what happens in your application. A log consists of a name, a timestamp, and a JSON payload.

## Log Structure

A valid log object contains the following fields:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `name` | string | **Yes** | The name of the log (e.g., `signup.completed`). |
| `user_id` | string | No | The ID of the user who performed the action. |
| `data` | object | No | Arbitrary JSON object with log properties. |
| `timestamp` | string | No | ISO 8601 timestamp. Defaults to `now`. |

## Sending Logs

Use the `log` method to record a log.

```typescript
await client.log({
  name: 'invoice.paid',
  user_id: 'cus_8374',
  data: {
    invoice_id: 'inv_993',
    amount: 2000,
    currency: 'usd'
  }
});
```

## Naming Conventions

We recommend using a `noun.verb` syntax for your log names. This keeps your data organized and easy to search.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Good" icon="check" color="#16A34A">
    * `project.created`
    * `user.signup`
    * `payment.failed`
  </Card>
  <Card title="Bad" icon="xmark" color="#DC2626">
    * `created project`
    * `User Clicked Signup Button`
    * `fail`
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Batching

For high-throughput applications, you can send up to 100 logs in a single batch request using `logBatch`.

```typescript
const logs = [
  { name: 'page.view', user_id: 'u_1' },
  { name: 'page.view', user_id: 'u_2' }
];

await client.logBatch(logs);
```
