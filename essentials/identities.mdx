Identities allow you to attach permanent traits to a `user_id`. When you send logs with that `user_id`, Userplex automatically associates the log with these traits.

## Identifying Users

Call `identify` when a user signs up or updates their profile. You only need to send the fields that have changed.

```typescript
await client.identify({
  user_id: 'user_123', // Your internal ID
  email: 'grace@hopper.com',
  name: 'Grace Hopper',
  attributes: {
    plan: 'enterprise',
    team_size: 15,
    is_admin: true
  }
});
```

## Automatic Enrichment

Once a user is identified, you can use their attributes in your dashboard filters.

<Note>
If you filter by `attributes.plan = 'enterprise'`, Userplex will find all logs triggered by users with that plan, even if the log payload itself didn't contain the plan name.
</Note>

## Best Practices

*   **Stable IDs**: Use your database's primary key (e.g., UUID) as the `user_id`, not an email address or username which might change.
*   **Identify Early**: Call `identify` as soon as your user logs in to ensure subsequent logs are correctly attributed.
