description: Connect external databases to SeerStack.

Datasources allow you to visualize data that lives outside of SeerStack.

## Events (Built-in)

The **Events** datasource is available by default in every project. It contains all the event data you send via the SeerStack API.

## External Databases (Coming Soon)

We are currently building support for connecting external databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Snowflake. This will allow you to combine your product events with your business data in a single dashboard.
