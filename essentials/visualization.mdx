SeerStack allows you to create dashboards without writing SQL. You simply describe what you want to see.

## Boards

A **Board** is a collection of cards. You typically create boards for specific topics, like "Revenue", "Onboarding", or "System Health".

## Cards

Cards are individual charts or metrics. To create a card:

1.  Drag a **Card** onto your board.
2.  Type a request in English.
3.  SeerStack generates the SQL and renders the chart.

### Example Prompts

Here are some examples of what you can ask:

*   *"Show me a line chart of daily active users for the last 30 days."*
*   *"Count the number of `payment.failed` logs broken down by `currency`."*
*   *"List the top 10 users by `data.total_spend`."*
