This guide shows you how to integrate Userplex into your application. You'll learn how to authenticate, identify users, and send your first log.

## 1. Get your API Key

You need an API key to send data to Userplex.
1. Log in to the [Userplex Dashboard](https://app.userplex.com).
2. Go to **Settings > Developer**.
3. Copy your **Publishable Key**.

## 2. Install the SDK

Install the official Node.js library.

```bash
npm install userplex-node
```

## 3. Initialize the client

Import the library and pass your API key.

```typescript
import Userplex from 'userplex-node';

const client = new Userplex({
  apiKey: process.env.USERPLEX_API_KEY, // e.g. 'sk_live_...'
});
```

## 4. Send a log

Send a test log to verify your integration.

```typescript
await client.log({
  name: 'test.log',
  user_id: 'internal_user',
  data: {
    message: 'Hello World',
    browser: 'Chrome'
  }
});
```

Check your [Dashboard](https://app.userplex.com/events) — you should see the log appear instantly.
